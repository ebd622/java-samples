# Modularization
### Benefits of Modularization
Modularization offers multiple benefits, by helping to do the following (1):
* clearly define the boundaries of subsystems
* thoroughly encapsulate the internals of modules or subsystems
* clarify dependencies at compile time and runtime
* make applications more secure
* easily validate architectural specifications related to dependencies
* provide stricter access control
* create smaller, targeted deployments


List all modules in JRE java that are part of the JDK:

```
java --list-modules
```
